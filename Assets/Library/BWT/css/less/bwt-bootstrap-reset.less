 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * 
 * Twitter Bootstrap styles should be reset in this file. 
 *     
 * This should give a good style baseline for the site, that may be overriden in
 * specific cases as required. For example, generic heading (h1-h6) may be set 
 * in this file, but a panels.less file may restyle h2 heading where they appear
 * within a panel.
 *
 * 
 * Examples:
 *
 * Typography – You should use variables.less to do as much typography styling 
 * as possible, but some styling isn't possible. In this instance you should use 
 * this file. Typical element might be as follows, but this list is likely to 
 * grow
 *
 *     – h1-h6
 *     – h1-h6 > a
 *     – :p:first-child and .firstPara
 *     – a, a:hover, a:active and a.btn
 *     – ul, ol, and dl
 *     – blockquote
